# TII: AI Datathon Competition Submission

## Overview

This repository contains our submission for the AI Datathon competition, showcasing the implementation of a Logistic Regression Classifier from Scratch and a Feed-Forward Neural Network for Multi-class Classification. The entire development and experimentation process were conducted on Google Colab, providing a collaborative and efficient platform for machine learning tasks.

## Content

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`Problem 1 - Logistic Regression - Solution.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Logistic Regression Classifier from Scratch. This notebook explains the step-by-step process of building the model, including the mathematical foundation, weight calculations, and training.

- **`Problem 2 - Neural Network Classifier - Solution.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a Feed-Forward Neural Network for Multi-class Classification. The notebook covers the architecture of the neural network, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.


## How to Run

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab.
2. Execute each cell sequentially, ensuring dependencies are installed as needed.
